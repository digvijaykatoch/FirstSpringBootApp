# FirstSpringBootApp
This is a demo project I created using Spring boot in order to generate api documentation via swagger for a Topcoder challenge.

So far, I had only created APIs in spring using the traditional way, i.e. following the mvc pattern. However, Spring boot actually
makes it easy as you don't have to configure anything and someone with zero knowledge of Java or Spring MVC can setup a new app in
a matter of minutes.
